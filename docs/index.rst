********************************

The Streamflow Prediction Tool provides 15-day streamflow 
predicted estimates by using the European Center for Medium 
Range Weather Forecasts (ecmwf.int) runoff predictions routed 
with the RAPID (rapid-hub.org) program. The connection between 
the predicted and hindcasted runoff are generated with GIS tools
both from Esri as well as from open source contributions. 
Return period estimates and warning flags aid in determining the severity.

The Streamflow Prediction Tool was the result of a collaboration between:

- Brigham Young University
- Esri
- The European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts
- NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

The Streamflow Prediction Tool was developed at Brigham Young University 
with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. 1135483. 
The Streamflow Prediction Tool is part of a larger effort known as CI-Water (http://ci-water.org). 
The purpose of CI-Water is to develop cyber infrastructure for water resources decision support.

Currently, the Streamflow Prediction Tool is being developed and maintained by
the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center.
