********************************
Streamflow Prediction Tool 1.0.5
********************************

The Streamflow Prediction Tool provides 15-day streamflow 
predicted estimates by using the European Center for Medium 
Range Weather Forecasts (ecmwf.int) runoff predictions routed 
with the RAPID (rapid-hub.org) program. The connection between 
the predicted and hindcasted runoff are generated with GIS tools
both from Esri as well as from open source contributions. 
Return period estimates and warning flags aid in determining the severity.
